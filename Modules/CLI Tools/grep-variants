Hello!

Recently I published my ebook on GNU awk, which completes the trio of my books on GNU grep/sed/awk tools for cli text processing. I also included a chapter on ripgrep, because of its performance and features. You can use either of these links to get the bundle. Each book has a pdf and epub version.

The books are currently free to download, to help with quarantine learning.

You can view the book using these repos as well. The repo has markdown source, example/exercise files used in the book, list of changes between versions, etc.

Edit (Aug 2020): Solutions for the exercises have been added. You can also view the books online at:

I'd highly appreciate your feedback. I've tried to present features from the basics and build it step by step with plenty of examples. But a few things end up rushed or not explained well enough. Past feedback has helped me to improve some of these, so I hope you'd contribute as well.

Happy learning and stay safe :)
